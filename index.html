                <p>Down the street you can hear her scream you're a disgrace</p>
                <p>As she slams the door in his drunken face</p>
                <p>And now he stands outside</p>
                <p>And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool</p>
                <p>He cries oh, girl you must be mad,</p>
                <p>What happened to the sweet love you and me had?</p>
                <p>Against the door he leans and starts a scene,</p>
                <p>And his tears fall and burn the garden green</p>
                <p>And so castles made of sand fall in the sea, eventually</p>
                <p>A little Indian brave who before he was ten,</p>
                <p>Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends</p>
                <p>And he built up a dream that when he grew up</p>
                <p>He would be a fearless warrior Indian Cheif</p>
                <p>Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until</p>
                <p>Tomorrow he would sing his first war song and fight his first battle</p>
                <p>But something went wrong, surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night</p>
                <p>And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually</p>
                <p>There was a young girl, who's heart was a frown</p>
                <p>Cause she was crippled for life,</p>
                <p>And she couldn't speak a sound</p>
                <p>And she wished and prayed she could stop living,</p>
                <p>So she decided to die</p>
                <p>She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore</p>
                <p>And to her legs she smiled you wont hurt me no more</p>
                <p>But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say</p>
                <p>Look a golden winged ship is passing my way</p>
                <p>And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on going...</p>
                <p>And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, eventually</p>
